High School Student at Beijing Haidian Kaiwen Academy

Hello everyone! I am Yingying Ma, a high-achieving high school student with a passion for science and research. Currently, I am attending Beijing Haidian Kaiwen Academy.

I have excelled academically, with a 4.0+ GPA, a perfect ACT score of 36/36, and received the High Honor Roll by my school board. Throught my high school years, I have taken and tested many AP courses, achieving perfect scores for various subjects, and completed pre-college programs at Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania over the summer. My research interests span from environmental science, chemistry, biology, and planetary science, with several of my studies accepted for presentation at international conferences and published in reputable journals.
